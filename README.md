# Virtual-world

This is the code I wrote during **Phase 2** of the Self-driving car (no libraries)

You can also find **Phase 1** here:
https://github.com/Almesaody/Self-Driving-Car
But **Phase 2** is a standalone project until the end when the 2 code bases merge.

The code from **Phase 2** will appear here as the course progresses and will be divided into parts as follows:

  1. Spatial Graphs
  2. Graph Editor
  3. Dynamic Viewport
  4. Roads
  5. Buildings And Trees
  6. Fake 3D
  7. ...
